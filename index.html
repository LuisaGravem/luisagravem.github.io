    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The black box does not contain a main tube that has two holes (that connect to another tube) and an output tube connected to the second tube</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>Initially, the data we collected from the box showed that different amounts of water came out of the box with no regard to the amount of water inputted.</p>
    <p>My group's approach was to create a water reserve with two points the water could empty out</p>
    <p>depending on the amount of water in the box. Our results ended up being the opposite of the initial results.</p>
    <p>For example, when we input 50 mL, 25 mL consistently comes out</p>
    <p>Further, each output was less than the input.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Reasoning One</h1>
    <p>Models are (usually) scaled-down replicas of something else. They are useful because they allow someone to adjust an existing</p>
    <p>idea/object without destroying the original. Limitations can include materials, sturdiness, and size. Strengths include how easy it is to</p>
    <p>make many and how easy it is to adjust. The consistency of my group's results is the opposite of what we were aiming for, because</p>
    <p>the original data was extremely inconsistent.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Reasoning Two</h1>
    <p>The claim is correct because our data implies that there is some consistency to our results, which is the opposite of the original boxâ€™s</p>
    <p>data. Our data is convincing because we did five trials for every quantity of water.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Reasoning Three</h1>
    <p>If the proposed model was correct, our data would have varied greatly causing the inputs and outputs to be inconsistent. As this is not</p>
    <p>the case, it can safely be said that our model does not emulate the original box.</p>
