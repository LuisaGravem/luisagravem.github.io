    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The black box does not contain a main tube that has two holes (that connect to another tube) and an output tube connected to the second tube</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>Initially, the data we collected from the box showed that different amounts of water came out of the box with no regard to the amount of water inputted</p>
    <p>My group's approach was to create a water reserve with two points the water could empty out</p>
    <p>depending on the amount of water in the box. Our results ended up being the opposite of the initial results</p>
    <p>For example, when we input 50 mL, 25 mL consistently comes out</p>
    <p>Further, each output was less than the input.</p>
